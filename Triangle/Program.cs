/* Create a Triangle Tracker console application similar to the Triangle Tracker
    website we made in Intro.

    Make a console app with a Triangle class.

    Use Console.ReadLine() to gather three numbers from the user.

    Create a method in the Triangle class that takes these 3 numbers and returns
        what type of triangle (if any) they form:
        Equilateral: All sides are equal;
        Isosceles: Exactly 2 sides are equal;
        Scalene: No sides are equal.

    Not all combinations make valid triangles. If any side is longer than the
    other two sides combined, the lengths cannot form a triangle. For example,
    2, 2, and 8 does not make a triangle. Make sure to account for this.

    Write plain English spec descriptions first, including both an input and
    desired output for each test.
